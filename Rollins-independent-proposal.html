		<h2 class="sectionTitle">Overview:</h2>
		 <hr>
			<p>For our independent project ths semester, I want to expand on a previous project I have done. In Professors Anderson's class we had to create a mini portfolio for ourselves, and I would really like to expand that project.            
			Since I am graduating in December I think it would be very benefical to have a working portfolio that I can contiously build upon. I want this portfolio to be a balence of my academic career and personal one as well. Over the course of this assignment I am hoping to familiarize myself with new technologies that will be something that i can eventually add to said portolio.

	 <h2 class="sectionTitle">Goals:</h2>
	   <hr>
		<p>Some goals I have in relation to this project are; to become familar and learn how to use bootstrap, that is a tool I have heard of but have never used. Addtionaly, I have only used Adobe dreamwearver to create this proopsoal so I would like to learn more about this software and the addtional benefits. Overall, my main goal is to create a portfolio that is easy for me to add new content too, and continously update.</p>
		
		<h4>Technology wrong issues</h4>
		<ul>
		  <li>A goal of my project is to design with others in mind, as the text nentioned in Chapter one that people feel as if they are not important enought to design for and I do not want that message to come across with this independent design or any future designs. (Chapter 1) </li>
		  <li>In designing this project, I will keep in mind whom this design is to serve. Ultimately this is a project for school, myself, and any other reason; With that in mind I must design with those audiences in mind, meaning ensuriing not to alienate or leave out anyone who might want to view or consume the content (chapter1) </li>
